            <p class="text-align-center"><strong>Sneha Dubey</strong> is an <strong>Indian foreign (IFS) </strong> officer of the 2012 batch. <br><br>
                She has completed the union public service commission (UPSC) exam in her  first attempt.<br><br>
                
                India found one of its youngest diplomats Sneha Dubey to counter Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's rant on Kashmir at the UN General Assembly on Friday.<br><br>
                First Secretary Dubey gave a blistering reply to Khan in the UN General Assembly as she delivered India's strong Right of Reply from the UNGA hall. 
                <br><br>
                "We exercise our Right of Reply to one more attempt by the leader of Pakistan to tarnish the image of this august Forum by bringing in matters internal to my country, and going so far as to spew falsehoods on the world stage," Dubey said in the UNGA.
                <br><br>
                "While such statements deserve our collective contempt and sympathy for the mindset of the person who utters falsehood repeatedly, I am taking the floor to set the record straight,‚Äù she said in her video address to the 76th session of the UNGA.
                <br><br>
                Dubey, a 2012 batch IFS officer, has an MA and MPhil from Jawaharlal Nehru University and was Under Secretary (T) Latin America and the Caribbean in the Ministry of External Affairs from December 2013 to August 2014. She was then Third Secretary in the Embassy of India in Madrid, according to her LinkedIn profile Dubey asserted that Pakistan PM Imran Khan had "misused" platforms provided by the UN to "propagate false and malicious propaganda against my country".
                <br><br>
                She said terrorists enjoyed a "free pass" in Pakistan while bringing up the plight of the minorities. Dubey said the lives of minority communities in Pakistan was "turned upside down".
